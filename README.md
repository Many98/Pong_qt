# Pong_qt

#### This project was created for learning purpose and of course for fun.

Game supports currently only keyboard control over pads. 
There are two modes two players and single player mode.
Game has simple gui and toolbar with posibility to control sounds and 
sizes of game play items and speed.
Window has autosclaing feature.


### Known issues:
After fast scaling of window may menu be a bit shifted.

### Future work:

If there will be a time I want to add mouse control option
and let ball accelerating in mode with mouse control
